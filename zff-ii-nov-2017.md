# ZFF II Notes November 2017

## BETA NOTES
* Include discussion on recorded sessions
* Mic policy
* Need to include 'service_manager' => 'abstract_factories' => AdapterAbstractFactory in the presentation
* Suggestion: flip code slides to black on white

## VM NOTES
* If you installed VirtualBox and vagrant, but get a message after running ¨vagrant up¨
  to the effect that you are missing a provider and that you need to install VirtualBox,
  check for compatibility issues between your OS, vagrant and VirtualBox

## ERRATA
* http://localhost:9999/#/3/23: delegator assignment needs to be array
* http://localhost:9999/#/3/8: 'MyClass' needs to be at same level as 'service_manager'
